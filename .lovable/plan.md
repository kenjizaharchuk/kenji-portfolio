## About Section Text Updates

### File: `src/components/AboutSection.tsx`

**1. Remove "Physical" from the bio paragraph**

Change:
> "specializing in Physical Manufacturing and Product Realization at Stanford"

To:
> "specializing in Manufacturing and Product Realization at Stanford"

**2. Increase opacity on "Welcome to my website!" subtitle**

Change the subtitle's class from `text-foreground/80` to `text-foreground/90` so it stands out slightly more than the body text while remaining softer than the main heading.

Body paragraphs stay at `text-foreground/80` as they are now.
